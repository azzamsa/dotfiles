- First time migrating to a DE after years of using a WM, [Mar 29, 2022](https://github.com/azzamsa/dotfiles/commit/376e66797cc6cc9914af727f0a8f2396286d4e10).
- Second exposure to Go, [Dec 9, 2018](https://github.com/azzamsa/dotfiles/commit/2eb5b017c015fba240182aba3f2027e31050613d).
  - My first exposure to Go was on April 21, 2016, when I compared loop performance in C, Go, and Java. I first heard about Go from @epsi-rns.
  - The result was: C the fastest, Go second, and Java third; 1. C (2 seconds) 2. Go (7 seconds) 3. Java (30 seconds) -- Azzam S.A on Facebook.
- Second exposure to Rust, [Aug 6, 2018](https://github.com/azzamsa/dotfiles/commit/ecf85e6a4fe7514bee6fa9cf57df7ef425e711e2).
  - I think I first heard about Rust around the same time as Go. I’m fairly sure I didn’t include it in the benchmark because installation was difficult at the time, but my memory could be off
  - The only recorded activity I found was from early 2018 in my calendar, but I believe it was actually earlier when I watched my first [Rust video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EPsnf_ZYU0) on Mozilla’s website.
  - Yes, it was sometime between 2016–2017. On May 21, 2017, [κeen](https://x.com/blackenedgold) had the Rust logo on his Twitter account and told me that his team was using Rust as one of their languages.
